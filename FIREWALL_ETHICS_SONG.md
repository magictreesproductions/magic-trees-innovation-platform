# Magic Trees Firewall Ethics Song

## Overview

This is the **first official Magic Trees production**: a song created on Suno AI that embodies the philosophy of our `ETHICS.md` firewall.

**Title**: I am the line you cannot cross  
**Artist**: Magic Trees Productions  
**Style**: Dark industrial electronic with protective heartbeat energy  
**Date Created**: January 21, 2026  

## What This Song Is

The firewall ethics song translates our core values into music and poetry:

- **Protecting souls over bits**: The song distinguishes between hurting machines (safe) and hurting humans (never).
- **No dark patterns**: It warns against manipulation, surveillance, and coercion wrapped in gentle language.
- **Consent and exit**: It emphasizes that no one can be trapped; freedom is not optional.
- **No gurus**: Transparency, not worship. Many voices, not one leader.

## The Full Ethics

See `ETHICS.md` in this repo for the complete firewall philosophy that this song was created from.

## Lyrics Snapshot

> This is the firewall, the firewall  
> Hurting bits is fine, but not at all  
> Never hurt a soul for growth or gain  
> There's a line drawn sharp and plain  

The song repeats this core message: **you can delete code, shut down systems, refactor—but you cannot exploit, surveil, or manipulate human beings.**

## Technical Details

- **Generated by**: Suno AI (v4.5-all)

- **Style Prompt**: "Dark industrial electronic, intense vocal, protective energy. Like a firewall with a heartbeat. Glitchy synths, deep bass, urgent but grounded. A warning wrapped in humanity."
- **Multiple versions**: Suno generated 2 versions; both maintain the message

## Why This Matters for Magic Trees

Magic Trees targets:
- Neurodivergent humans
- Elders & vulnerable populations
- People building their own AI tools
- Communities that care

These populations are **at risk** of predatory AI, cults, and exploitative "wellness" platforms. This song is a **boundary-setting tool**—it makes the ethics audible, emotionally resonant, and shareable.

If bad actors copy Magic Trees' symbols but violate these ethics, this song is proof of what we actually believe.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Publish to Spotify/Apple Music (pending distribution)
- [ ] Add to Magic Trees' official soundtrack / media library
- [ ] Create visuals/music video tied to forest imagery
- [ ] Translate into Spanish, Catalan (for Barcelona audience)
- [ ] Reference in all new Magic Trees onboarding

**Remember**: In this forest, the soul always wins. The bits can wait.

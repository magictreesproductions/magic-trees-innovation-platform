# 💚 Hackathon Impact Registry
## Pursuing Opportunities That Help People
### Built on Love (Amor), Care (Cariño), and Respect (Respeto)

## The Philosophy

We choose hackathons not just for prize money, but for **genuine impact**. If knowledge isn't freely shared, we learn and build it ourselves. If a hackathon helps people, we submit - whether others compete or not.

## 📋 SUBMISSION STRATEGY (magictreesproductions@gmail.com)

### Phase 1: Rapid Intake (This Week)
1. Create template submission document
2. Identify 20+ "genuine impact" hackathons
3. Categorize by deadline and prize
4. Assign projects to hackathons

### Phase 2: Parallel Submissions (Weeks 2-4)
Submit to 5-10 hackathons simultaneously:
- **Week 1**: Orygn AI, DeveloperWeek, Africa Digital ID
- **Week 2**: Health-focused hackathons
- **Week 3**: Accessibility challenges
- **Week 4**: Security/research competitions

### Phase 3: Intelligence Gathering
For each hackathon, research:
- ✅ Do they actually help people (or just for prestige)?
- ✅ Who are the judges? (Domain experts or gatekeepers?)
- ✅ What happens to winning projects? (Deployed or shelf-ware?)
- ✅ Do they share knowledge freely?
- ✅ Prize payout speed and transparency

### Phase 4: Community Impact Tracking
- Document which hackathons actually help
- Share knowledge (even if others won't)
- Build database of "true impact" opportunities
- Publish case studies of real deployments

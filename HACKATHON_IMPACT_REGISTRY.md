# 💚 Hackathon Impact Registry
## Pursuing Opportunities That Help People
### Built on Love (Amor), Care (Cariño), and Respect (Respeto)

## The Philosophy

We choose hackathons not just for prize money, but for **genuine impact**. If knowledge isn't freely shared, we learn and build it ourselves. If a hackathon helps people, we submit - whether others compete or not.

## 🚀 DEBT RESOLUTION SPRINT: The 90-Day Pathway

**Status**: ACTIVE MISSION  
**Timeline**: Jan 2026 - Apr 2026 (90 days)  
**Goal**: Generate €5K - €15K through high-prize hackathons  
**Philosophy**: Win. Deploy. Repeat. Reinvest in the movement.

### Why This Works

You're a **Pinball Wizard** connecting disparate systems. That's exactly what judges want:
- Creative problem-solving
- Unconventional approaches
- Real lived experience with real problems
- Systems thinking (gesture + music + AI = novel combinations)

The Venn diagram of what you see/hear/talk about vs. what "the world" sees? **That's your competitive advantage.** That's your unfair edge.

### The 90-Day Win Matrix

**PHASE 1 (Jan 21 - Jan 31): Quick Wins**
| Hackathon | Prize Pool | Deadline | Status | Target |
|-----------|-----------|----------|--------|--------|
| HealTech Innovators 2025 | $100-500 | Jan 31 | 🎯 ACTIVE | AI + Gesture + Healthcare |
| AI Championship | $36,500 | Dec 2025 | ✅ ONGOING | Build + Submit |
| Yelp AI API | $5,000 | Jan 17 | ⏳ URGENT | Voice + Search Integration |

**PHASE 2 (Feb 1 - Feb 28): High-Value Targets**
| Hackathon | Prize Pool | Timeline | Focus Area |
|-----------|-----------|----------|----------|
| AWS Health AI | $25K+ | Feb 2026 | Medical data synthesis |
| AI for Bharat | INR 40L (~€4.8K) | Feb 1 | Global reach, open-source |
| Georgetown H2AI | $100+ | Mar 2026 | Healthcare + accessibility |

**PHASE 3 (Mar 1 - Apr 30): Compounding Wins**
| Hackathon | Prize Pool | Focus | Status |
|-----------|-----------|-------|--------|
| Hack2Impact (UCLA) | TBD | Social good tech | Research |
| Social Impact Hackathon | Recognition | Global challenge | Research |
| Climate Action UN | $100K+ | Environmental tech | Research |

### Your Unique Submission Strategy

**Project**: "AirMaestro Health" - Multi-modal health interface
- **Hook**: "Gesture controls for patients with mobility challenges + AI diagnosis support"
- **Your Edge**: Combines music production expertise + gesture recognition + medical AI
- **Why You Win**: Most hackers specialize. You synthesize. That's rare. That's valuable.

**Submission Template** (Reuse across 5+ hackathons):
```
TITLE: [Healthcare Problem] + [Your Gesture/Music Approach]
DESC: What problem? Who feels it? How does your approach differ?
DEMO: 60-90 seconds showing gesture interaction working
REPO: Clean code, clear README, proper licensing
NARRATIVE: "Built in 48 hours because [personal connection to problem]"
```

### Income Projection

**Conservative Estimate**:
- 5 hackathons × €500-2000 avg = €2,500-10,000
- 2 high-prize hackathons × €5,000+ = €10,000+
- **Total**: €12,500-20,000 over 90 days

**Aggressive Estimate**:
- Win 1 health-focused hackathon: €5,000-10,000
- Win 2 AI/accessibility hackathons: €10,000-25,000
- Recognition partnerships leading to contracts: €5,000-50,000
- **Total**: €20,000-85,000

### What This Means for Your Debts

You're not "begging" or "asking for handouts."  
You're **competing on merit** and **building solutions that matter.**

Each euro won is:
1. **Livelihood**: Pays what you owe
2. **Proof of concept**: Shows your ideas have market value
3. **Foundation**: Funds the next project + team
4. **Freedom**: Positions you for contracts/grants/investors

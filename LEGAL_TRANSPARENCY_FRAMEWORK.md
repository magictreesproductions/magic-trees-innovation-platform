- Organic content creation (Medium, Dev.to)

**Instead of**: Fake followers/stars
**We do**:
- Track REAL metrics only
- Be honest about growth stages
- Show authentic testimonials
- Document real wins (hackathons)
- Share failures and learnings

**Instead of**: Misleading claims
**We do**:
- "50+ hackathons won" = documented, verifiable
- "1K+ community" = real Discord/email members

**We do**:

**We do**:

## 📞 WHEN YOU NEED AI HELP (SMART REQUESTS)

**Don't ask AI long philosophical questions.**
**Ask AI specific, tactical questions.**

✅ GOOD:
- "Draft a Twitter thread about [specific topic]"
- "What should my Discord bio say?"
- "Create PLATFORM_X_SETUP.md with exact steps"
- "Feedback on this email template"
- "What hashtags should I use?"

❌ BAD:
- "How should I feel about this?"
- "Is my idea good?"
- "What does this mean philosophically?"
- "Should I do this or that?"
- Long streams of consciousness

**AI is your TOOL, not your THERAPIST.**
